# Ocelot Boilerplate for .NET 5.0 in VB.net

This is a minimal API server example using Ocelot and dynamic routing from within the code.

All you have to do is copy one of the existing Controllers files to a new file and rename it accordingly.

By default it launches on port 9001. You can test the following URLS:

http://localhost:9001/api/customers

http://localhost:9001/api/products

http://localhost:9001/api/pricing
